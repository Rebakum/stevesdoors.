            A Decade of Akbar Dore
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg ">
            Under the dynamic leadership of Alhaj Akbar Hossain, Akbar Dore has
            established itself as one of Bangladesh&#39;s leading construction
            and engineering firms over the past ten years. Alongside the
            countryâ€™s development efforts, Akbar Dore has built up a significant
            reputation both at home and abroad. As a notable achievement of this
            decade, Akbar Dore successfully completed the construction of the
            1400-seat new permanent campus of North South University, the first
            and most prominent private university in Bangladesh. To support
            Bangladesh&#39;s development, Akbar Dore has executed various
            successful projects for the army, navy, air force, police,
            government, semi-government, and private sectors, thereby playing an
            important role in the country&#39;s infrastructure.
